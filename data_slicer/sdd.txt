Software design document
Data slicer block
Information about slicing can be found here:

Requirements
 1 The data slicer shall be able to use the raw data samples and compare them to an internal threshold to generate binary (0 or 1) output signals.
 2 Processing shall take place on a per-sample basis.
 3 All processing shall take place in one system clock cycle
 4 Threshold generation shall be done with digital RC low pass filter blocks.


Interface
 All logic is referenced to the system clock. Input data is sampled on the rising edge of input clock. A high-state on reset brings the system into a predictable state, discarding all internal memory. 
Input clock is used as clock-enable, it shall therefore be high only for one system clock period, if one sample is to input.

Verification
 The design shall be tested for correct function with the help of a hdl testbench. A text-file shall be used as test stimulus and has to include one sample on every line. Results shall be written to a output file and be analysed with a waveform viewer afterwards.
