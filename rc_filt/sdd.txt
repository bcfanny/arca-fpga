Digital RC low pass filter block

Requirements
 1 RC filter block shall filter a discrete, digital signal by means of a digital RC low pass filter
 2 Processing shall take place on a per-sample basis.
 3 All processing shall take place in one system clock cycle
 4 The RC-filter shall have configurable time constant 

Interface
 All logic is referenced to the system clock. Input data is sampled on the rising edge of input clock. A high-state on reset brings the system into a predictable state, discarding all internal memory. 
Input clock is used as clock-enable, it shall therefore be high only for one system clock period, if one sample is to input. Generics have to be available to input time constant.

Verification
 The design shall be tested for correct function with the help of a hdl testbench. A text-file shall be used as test stimulus and has to include one input sample on every line. Results shall be written to a output file and verified with a matlab script afterwards. This verification includes visual inspection of the output waveform and time domain error distribution.
